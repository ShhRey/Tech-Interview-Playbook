# Design Patterns are the best practices you didn't know you needed until you hit the same design poroblem for the third time.
# They are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They provide a shared vocabulary, promote best practices, and help you build flexible, extensible, and maintainable systems.

#============================================================================ Different Categrories of Design Patterns ===============================================================================#
'''
1. Creational Patterns (How Objects are Created)
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.
- Singleton: Ensure a class has only one instance.
- Factory Method: Delegate object creation to subclasses.
- Abstract Factory: Create families of related objects.
- Builder: Construct complex objects step-by-step.
- Prototype: Clone existing objects instead of creating new ones.


2. Structural Patterns (How Objects are Composed)
These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.
- Adapter: Makes one interface compatible with another.
- Decorator: Adds new responsibilities to an object at runtime.
- Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.
- Composite: Treats individual and grouped objects uniformly.
- Proxy: Acts as a placeholder or access control for another object.


3. Behavioral Patterns (How Objects Interact)
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.
- Strategy: Enables selecting an algorithm at runtime.
- Observer: Notifies dependent objects of state changes.
- Command: Encapsulates a request as an object.
- State: Allows an object to change behavior based on internal state.
- Template Method: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class.
